To compile & run this code, first download the vm.c file and any requisite
input files to the same directory.

Use "gcc -g vm.c" to generate a program file from the .c file.

You can now run the program while passing in your input file with this
command: "./a.out input_file.txt".

During runtime, insert any required values into the terminal to progress
the program until the HLT command is reached.

The expected output will be shown directly in the terminal.

Note: After "gcc -g vm.c", depending on your system will generate a different a.out file
    - Window: a.exe
    - Linus: a.out
